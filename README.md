## 🚀 Overview

This monorepo contains the frontend applications and shared packages for the McGill Rocket Team's ground station system. It provides real-time telemetry monitoring, command control, and data visualization capabilities integrated with YAMCS (Yet Another Mission Control System).

## 📦 Repository Structure

### Applications (`apps/`)

#### **`@mrt/backend`** - YAMCS Data Server

This is the main server which handles receiving, processing and sending telemetry. It's the middle man between data sources and the frontend ui. It runs through the [YAMCS](https://yamcs.org/) framework.

#### **`@mrt/frontend`** - Main Ground Station UI

The application that users use to view live telemetry and issue commands. Comes with a configurable card ui and more.

#### **`@mrt/simulator`** - Telemetry Data Simulator

Generate random data for development of the frontend. Without the simulator, we would have no way of testing the frontend with data.

### Packages (`packages/`)

#### **`@mrt/yamcs-effect`** - YAMCS API Client Library

- **Purpose**: Type-safe [Effect-TS](https://effect.website/docs/quickstart) client for YAMCS
- **Features**:
  - HTTP API client for YAMCS REST endpoints
  - WebSocket client for real-time telemetry subscriptions
  - Comprehensive schema definitions for YAMCS data structures
  - Support for parameters, commands, links, and time events

#### **`@mrt/yamcs-atom`** - React State Management Layer

- **Purpose**: Reactive state management using [Effect Atom](https://github.com/tim-smart/effect-atom)
- **Features**:
  - Pre-configured atoms for YAMCS subscriptions (parameters, commands, links, time)
  - Automatic WebSocket connection management
  - Real-time data synchronization with React components
  - Error handling and retry logic

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22+
- **pnpm** 10.26.1+
- **Maven** 3.9+
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**
- **Tilt** (for development orchestration)

## 📋 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/McGillRocketTeam/ground-station
cd ground-station
# Install dependencies for all packages
pnpm install
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Everything with Tilt

**Tilt** orchestrates the entire development environment, including all Docker services and applications.

```bash
# Start all services and applications
tilt up
```

This will start:

- **Frontend dev server** (`http://localhost:5173`)
- **Simulator** with YAMCS instance="ground_station"
- **All Docker services**:
  - Backend (`ghcr.io/mcgillrocketteam/groundstation-backend-2026:main`)
  - MQTT broker (Eclipse Mosquitto, port 1883)
  - Map tile server (port 3001)

## 🔧 Individual Package Development

### Frontend Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @mrt/frontend dev
```

### Simulator (requires environment variable)

```bash
YAMCS_INSTANCE=ground_station pnpm --filter @mrt/simulator dev
```

### Build All Packages

```bash
pnpm turbo run build
```

### Type Checking

```bash
pnpm turbo run check-types
```
